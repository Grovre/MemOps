The cheat table is just 3 or 4 pointers used to track down static offsets available in AssaultCube.cs

The pointermaps were all generated in separate game sessions towards the local player's rifle ammo address

entlist ptrs, I'm not really sure but I think they were pointers to the entity list. Didn't use them in the end. Don't use

ptrs was just a temp file for every pointer scan, don't use
